1. bukkit -> php
   - Added /Output/PrintToConsole:message /Output/PrintToPlayer:message /Output/PrintToPlayer-playerName:message and /Output/Broadcast:message
   - ExecuteBukkitCommand has been replaced with ExecutePlayerCommand. Finally!
   - Added ExecuteScript:scriptname. See point 3 for details.
   - Added onlinePlayersIP[]. Contains ips of players specified in onlinePlayers[]
2. php -> bukkit -> php
   Completely rewritten. Use the supplied Websend.php as a php api for your php -> bukkit scripts. 
   Syntax of older versions will NOT work with this version.
   This version also has a limited implementation of output returing. Read more here: http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/websend/pages/plugin-output-capturing-beta/
   (Note: I have had some trouble with using this because the unpack function used in the readByte() function stopped working after a while. 
   Report if you have the same problem. Please contact me if you know a solution.)
3. Websend Java scripts (NOT javascript!)
   New feature. Allows you to write scripts in Java. These will be compiled and loaded into the JVM on server start.
   These scripts are callable via php scripts.
4. Trusted Hosts
   This acts as a whitelist for connections. Default allows all connections. To change, edit trusted.txt

There may be more things that I already forgot about.
